# Neyman Pearson

## Neyman-Pearson
* For testing between $H_{0}: \theta = \theta_{0}$ vs $H_{\alpha}: \theta = \theta_{\alpha}$
(note both are simple hypothesis), the test with the reject region determined by 

$$
\frac{L(\theta_{0})}{L(\theta_{\alpha})}<t
$$

$\quad\quad$ where $t$ is **fine tuned** s.t. $P_{H_{0}} (\frac{L(\theta_{0})}{L(\theta_{\alpha})}  <t ) = \alpha$, is the most powerful $\alpha$-level test for $H_{0}$ vs $H_{\alpha}$

### Remarks
* If the hypotheses are two simple hypotheses, and if you do not know
where to start to build a test, start with $\frac{L(\theta)}{L(\theta_{\alpha}} <t$. Because it will give the most powerful test, among all those which control the type I error rate at $\alpha$
