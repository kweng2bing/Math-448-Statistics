CEO of a company claims that customers prefer their product 'A' over the competitior's product 'B'

Let p = be the population proportion that chose product 'A' over 'B'

$H_{0}$: The probability that customer likes product 'A' is 0.5
$H_{1}$: The probability that customer likes product 'A' is >0.5

$\hat{p} = \frac{3000}{5000}$
* $\hat{p}$ is a sample parameter and $p$ is population.
    * Cannot draw conclusion on population paramter using sample parameter.
        * Even if $\hat{p}= \frac{5000}{5000}$, we cannot conclude $H_{1}$
        * Sample size also doesn't draw conclusion



A test statistic is a function of the sample emasuremeent sbased on which we will make the staticial decasion about the hypothesis

TS = \frac{\text{ the estimator - the hypothesized value in} H_{0} }{\text{the standard error of the estimator}}

TS = \frac{\hat{\theta} - \theta_{0}}{SE(\hat{\theta})}
* Small value : closer to null and support null

* If TS is not in the Reject Rejion, we **fail to reject the null hypothesis** or **do not have evidence to reject**
> Remark: It is not correct to say we accept the null hypothesis
H_{0}: \theta = \theta_{0}





3 Methods for Hypothesis
* Reject Region
* p-value
* considence interval
>> All perform hypothesis tetsting

1. What is the decision rule
* Reason to judge reject/no reject
* Advantage/Disadvantage for each
* Difference
