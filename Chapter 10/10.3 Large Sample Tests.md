# Large Sample Tests

## Test Statistic for $\theta = p$
* Option 1
    $$TS = \frac{\hat{p}-p_{0}}{\sigma_{\hat{p}}}= \frac{\hat{p}-p_{0}}{\sqrt{\frac{p_{0} (1-p_{0})}{n}}}$$
    * $SE(p)$ when $\hat{p}$ is true
    * When $n$ is large, $TS \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)$ under $H_{0}$
    * One layer of approximation
* Option 2
    $$TS = \frac{\hat{p}-p_{0}}{\sigma_{\hat{p}}}= \frac{\hat{p}-p_{0}}{\sqrt{\frac{\hat{p} (1-\hat{p})}{n}}}$$
    * $\sigma_{\hat{p}} \approx SE(p)$ whether $H_{0}$ is true or not 
    * If $H_{0}$ is true, and $n$ is large, $TS \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)$
    * Two layers of approximation $\rightarrow$ less accurate

## Common large-sample tests Procedure
1. If the parameter of interest $\theta$ is one of the following: $\mu, \mu_{1} -\mu_{2}, p, p_{1} - p_{2}$
2. Sample size $n$ is large enough
    * Null Hypothesis: $H_{0}: \theta = \theta_{0}$
    * Alternative Hypothesis:
        * $H_{\alpha}: \theta > \theta_{0}$ (one sided test)
        * $H_{\alpha}: \theta < \theta_{0}$ (one sided test)
        * $H_{\alpha}: \theta \neq \theta_{0}$ (one sided test)
3. Using the sample data to find an estimator of $\theta$, denoted $\hat{\theta}$
    * Find TS
    $$TS = \frac{\hat{\theta} - \theta_{0}}{\sigma_{\hat{\theta}}} \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1) \textbf{ under } H_{0}$$
    * Find Reject Region
        * $\{ TS > z_{\alpha} \}$ (one sided test)
        * $\{ TS < -z_{\alpha} \}$ (one sided test)
        * $\{ |TS| > z_{\alpha/2} \}$ (two sided test)
4. Using RR draw the decision and conclusion
