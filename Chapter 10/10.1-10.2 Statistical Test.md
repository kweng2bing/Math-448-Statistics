# Hypothesis Testing

## Terminology
* **Hypothesis:** A statement about a population, ususally of the form that a parameter takes a particular numerical value
* **Null Hypothesis**:, $H_{0}$, statement of no effect
* **Alternative Hypothesis**:, $H_{1}$, statement of some effect

## Common Misconception
Problem: CEO of a company claims that customers prefer their product 'A' over the competitior's product 'B'

Let $p$ = be the population proportion that chose product 'A' over 'B'
* $H_{0}$: The probability that customer likes product 'A' is 0.5
* $H_{1}$: The probability that customer likes product 'A' is >0.5

Suppose we have $\hat{p} = \frac{3000}{5000}$
* $\hat{p}$ is a sample parameter and $p$ is population.
    * Cannot draw conclusion on population paramter using sample parameter.
        * Even if $\hat{p}= \frac{5000}{5000}$, we cannot conclude anything $H_{1}$
        * Size of sample size also doesn't draw conclusion
## Test Statistic
* A function of the sample data used to determine whether to reject the null Hypothesis or do not reject null Hypothesis (make statistical decision about the hypothesis).
* Measure the **compatability** between the null hypothesis and the data
    * If TS is far from 0, data not compatible with null hypothesis
    * If TS is close to 0, data compatible with null hypothesis
$$TS = \frac{\text{ the estimator - the hypothesized value in} H_{0} }{\text{the standard error of the estimator}}$$

$$TS = \frac{\hat{\theta} - \theta_{0}}{\sigma_{\hat{\theta}}} $$

* Smaller value: closer to null and support null hypothesis

## Reject Region
* The region of the test statistic space where the null hypothesis is rejected in favor of the alternative hypothesis $H_{\alpha}$
* If TS is not in the Reject Region, we **fail to reject the null hypothesis** or **do not have evidence to reject**
> Remark: It is not correct to say we accept the null hypothesis

## Types of Error

### Type I and II Error
----
| | $H_{0}$ True | $H_{0}$ False | 
|:---| :---| :----|
| Reject $H_{0}$ | Type I Error |  |
| Fail to Reject $H_{0}$ |  | Type II Error |

* Type I Error: $P(\text{ Reject } H_{0} | H_{0} \text{ True}) = \alpha$

* Type II Error: $P(\text{Fail to Reject }H_{0}| H_{0} \text{ False}) = \beta$

### Examples
Suppose $H_{0}:$ A drug is safe
* Type I Error: A drug is rejected by FDA when it is actually safe and effective 
* Type II Error: A drug is not rejected by FDA when it is actually harmful to patients.

## Power
* The **power** of a test is the proability that the null hypothesis is rejected when it's false

Power: $\eta = P( \text{ reject } H_{0} \vert H_{0} \text{ is false }) = 1 - \beta$

## Choosing $\alpha, \beta$
* Ideally, we want $\alpha$ and $\beta$ to be as small as possible
    * As $t > 0$ *increases*, harder to reject $H_{0}$. Then $\alpha \downarrow, \beta \uparrow$
    * As $t > 0$ *decreases*, easier to reject $H_{0}$. Then $\alpha \uparrow, \beta \downarrow$
* For Research: Type I Error more serious than a Type II Error 
    * Common values for $\alpha$ = 0.1, 0.05, 0.01, 0.001

## Revisit Type I Error: $\alpha$

* Occurs when we reject $H_{0}$ when $H_{0}$ is true
* Probability of Type I Error

$$
\begin{align*}
\alpha &= P(\text{Type I Error})\\
&= P(\text{Reject } H_{0} \,|\, H_{0} \text{ is true})\\
&= P( TS\in RR \,\vert\,\theta =\theta_{0})\\
\end{align*}
$$

### Conclsuion: 
* If $\alpha = 0.05$, this means that $5%$ of the time, a typical sample from a population where $H_{0}$ is actually 
true will lead to the rejection of $H_{0}$
* If we reject $H_{0}$ at the level $\alpha$, we say, " **At the significance level $\alpha = 0.05$**, 
there is sufficient evidence to support the statement that we reject $H_{0}$ "
* If we fail to reject $H_{0}$ at the level $\alpha$, we say, " **At the significance level $\alpha = 0.05$**, 
there is not sufficient evidence to support the statement that we reject $H_{0}$ "

## Revisit Type II Error
* Occurs when we fail to reject $H_{0}$ when $H_{0}$ is false
* Probability of Type II Error

$$
\begin{align*}
\beta &= P(\text{Type II Error})\\
&= P(\text{fail to reject } H_{0} \ \vert \ \theta \in H_{\alpha}) \\
&= P(TS \not\in RR \ \vert \, \theta \in H_{\alpha})  \\
&= P(\text{fail to reject } H_{0} \ \vert \ H_{0} \text{ is false}) \\
&= P(TS \not\in RR \ \vert H_{0} \text{ is false})  \\
\end{align*}
$$

$TS = \frac{\hat{\theta} - \theta}{SE(\hat{\theta})} = \frac{\hat{p} - 0.5}{\sqrt{\frac{\hat{p} (1-p)}{n}}}$
