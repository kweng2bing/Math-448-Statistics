# Hypothesis Testing

## Terminology
* **Hypothesis:** A statement about a population, ususally of the form that a parameter takes a particular numerical value
* **Null Hypothesis**:, $H_{0}$, statement of no effect
* **Alternative Hypothesis**:, $H_{1}$, statement of some effect
## Test Statistic
* A function of the sample data used to determine whether to reject the null Hypothesis or do not reject null Hypothesis (make statistical decision about the hypothesis).
* Measure the **compatability** between the null hypothesis and the data
    * If TS is far from 0, data not compatible with null hypothesis
    * If TS is close to 0, data compatible with null hypothesis
$$TS = \frac{\text{ the estimator - the hypothesized value in} H_{0} }{\text{the standard error of the estimator}}$$

$$TS = \frac{\hat{\theta} - \theta_{0}}{\sigma_{\hat{\theta}}} $$

* Smaller value: closer to null and support null hypothesis

## Reject Region
* The region of the test statistic space where the null hypothesis is rejected in favor of the alternative hypothesis $H_{\alpha}$
* If TS is not in the Reject Region, we **fail to reject the null hypothesis** or **do not have evidence to reject**
> Remark: It is not correct to say we accept the null hypothesis

## Types of Error

### Type I and II Error
----
| | $H_{0}$ True | $H_{0}$ False | 
|:---| :---| :----|
| Reject $H_{0}$ | Type I Error |  |
| Fail to Reject $H_{0}$ |  | Type II Error |

* Type I Error: $P(\text{ Reject } H_{0} | H_{0} \text{ True}) = \alpha$

* Type II Error: $P(\text{Fail to Reject }H_{0}| H_{0} \text{ False}) = \beta$

## Power
Power: $P( \text{ reject } H_{0} \vert H_{0} \text{ is false })$


### Example 1
Problem: CEO of a company claims that customers prefer their product 'A' over the competitior's product 'B'

Let $p$ = be the population proportion that chose product 'A' over 'B'
* $H_{0}$: The probability that customer likes product 'A' is 0.5
* $H_{1}$: The probability that customer likes product 'A' is >0.5

Suppose we have $\hat{p} = \frac{3000}{5000}$
* $\hat{p}$ is a sample parameter and $p$ is population.
    * Cannot draw conclusion on population paramter using sample parameter.
        * Even if $\hat{p}= \frac{5000}{5000}$, we cannot conclude $H_{1}$
        * Size of sample size also doesn't draw conclusion



$H_{0}: \theta = \theta_{0}$

### Example 1 (Continued)

$TS = \frac{\hat{\theta} - \theta}{SE(\hat{\theta})} = \frac{\hat{p} - 0.5}{\sqrt{\frac{\hat{p} (1-p)}{n}}}$




### Examples
Suppose $H_{0}:$ A drug is safe
* Type I Error: A drug is rejected by FDA when it is actually safe and effective 
* Type II Error: A drug is not rejected by FDA when it is actually harmful to patients.


## Power
The power of a test is the probability that the null hpothesis is rejected when is is false

As $t > 0$ increases, harder to reject $H_{0}$. Then $\alpha \downarrow, \beta \uparrow$

Reject Region
* If TS $\in$ RR, then reject $H_{0}$ at the significance level of $\alpha$

If $\alpha = 0.05$, this means that $5\%$ of the time, a typical sample
