Limitation of RR and CI
* Cannot see the signifance of rejection
    * if TS falls into RR, that's it. $z_{\alpha}$ is fixed
    *
P-value
* tells how signifance finding is
* yes/no reject

p-value 
$\alpha$
both talk about extreme probability
* can interpret (ts >/< )

At the signifcance level alpha = 0.05, we fail to reject null hypothesis
