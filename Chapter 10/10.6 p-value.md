# P-value


## Limitation of RR and CI
* Cannot see the signifance of rejection
* if TS falls into RR, we reject at that signifcance level only
    * For a different $\alpha$ need to recompute


## P-value
* The p-value is the probability that the test statistic is as or more extreme than the observed value in the direction of $H_{\alpha}$ given that $H_{0}$ is true
    * Universal measure of the stength of the evidence/ significance 
    * describe how extreme the data would be if $H_{0}$ is true


## p-values for large sample tests
Alternative Hypothesis
* Case 1: $H_{\alpha}: \theta > \theta_{0} \Leftrightarrow  p\text{-value } =P (TS \geq ts  \ \vert\ \theta = \theta_{0}) = 1 - \Phi(ts)$
* Case 2: $H_{\alpha}: \theta <> \theta_{0} \Leftrightarrow  p\text{-value } =P (TS \leq ts  \ \vert\ \theta = \theta_{0}) = \Phi(ts)$
* Case 3: $H_{\alpha}: \theta \neq \theta_{0} \Leftrightarrow  p\text{-value } =P ( TS \geq |ts|  \ \vert\ \theta = \theta_{0}) + P ( |TS| \leq |ts|  \ \vert\ \theta = \theta_{0}) = 2(1 - \Phi(|ts|))$

At the signifcance level alpha = 0.05, we fail to reject null hypothesis
