# Small Sample Size (t- distribution)

## Problem
* Recall: Central Limit Theorem only applies if $n$ is large enough.
* For a large $n$ we used $S^{2}$ (sample variance) as an approximate for the population $\sigma^{2}$, but the variance behavior is more random and less reliable for a small sample
    * For a small sample uncertainity of $S^{2}$ needs to be considered


If $n$ is small, we use the t-distribution instead of the normal distribution.


## Notes to Add



$$
\begin{align*} 
& P(L \leq \frac{(n-1)S^{2}}{\sigma^{2}} \leq U)
\end{align*}
$$

Lower bound
$$P \bigg(\sigma^{2} \geq \frac{(n-1)S^{2}}{\chi^{2}_{\alpha}} \bigg) = 1- \alpha$$

Upper Bound
$$P \bigg(\sigma^{2} \leq \frac{(n-1)S^{2}}{\chi^{2}_{1-\alpha}} \bigg) = 1- \alpha$$
