# Small Sample Size (t- distribution)

## Problem
* Recall: Central Limit Theorem only applies if $n$ is large enough.
* For a large $n$ we used $S^{2}$ (sample variance) as an approximate for the population $\sigma^{2}$, but the variance behavior is more random and less reliable for a small sample
    * For a small sample uncertainity of $S^{2}$ needs to be considered

## $t$-Distribution
* If $n$ is small, we use the $t$-distribution instead of the normal distribution.
$$T =  \frac{\bar{Y} - \mu }{\sigma_{\bar{Y}}} = \frac{\bar{Y} = \mu}{\frac{S}{\sqrt{n}}} \sim t(n-1)$$

> T has $t$-distribution with degrees of freedom $ \text{d}f = n-1$

### Confidence Intervals

* 2 sided Confidence Intervals for $\mu$
$$[\bar{Y}-t\_{\frac{\alpha}{2}},\bar{Y}+t\_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}]$$

* 1-sided Upper Bound Confidence Interval for $\mu$
$$ (-\infty,\bar{Y}+t\_{\alpha}]$$
* 1-sided Lower Bound Confidence Interval for $\mu$
$$[\bar{Y}-t\_{\alpha},\infty)$$

## Construction of $t$ distribution

> Let $U_{1}, ... U_{v} \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)$. If $X \equiv U_{1}^{2} + ... + U_{v}^{2}$, then X follows $\chi^{2}$ distribution with $v$ degrees of freedom

Suppose $Z \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)$ and $X \sim \chi^{2}(v), Z \bot X$, then 

$$T \equiv \frac{Z}{\sqrt{\frac{X}{v}}}$$

* $T$ is said to follow $t$-distribution with $v$ degrees of freedom
$T \sim t(v)$
> $Z \bot X $ means $Z$ and $X$ and independent

## Properties of $t$ distribution
* $t(v)$ is close to $\mathcal{N}(0,1)$ for a large $v$
* PDF symmetric (like normal distribution)


## Theorems
1. If $Y_{i}$ iid and $Y_{i} \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_{Y}, \sigma^{2}_{Y})$ then $\frac{ \bar{Y} - \mu_{Y}}{\frac{\sigma_{Y}}{\sqrt{n}}} \sim N(0,1)$
2. 

> iid = independent identically distributed
