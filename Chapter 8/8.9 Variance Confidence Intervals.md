# Small Sample Size (t- distribution)

## Problem
* Recall: Central Limit Theorem only applies if $n$ is large enough.
* For a large $n$ we used $S^{2}$ as an approximate for the population $\sigma^{2}$, but the behavior is more random for a small sample 
    * For a small sample uncertainity of $S^{2}$ needs to be considered


If $n$ is small, we use the t-distribution instead of the normal distribution.
