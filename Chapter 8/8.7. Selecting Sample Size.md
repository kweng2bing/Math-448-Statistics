# 8.7 Selecting Sample Size


## Problem
* If we need to collect samples to make an inference about the population parameter, how large should $n$ be?
    * The more the better (Ideal but unrealistic)
    * Depends on your goal
## Point estimators
Recall for Point Estimators, we established a 2 standard bound $(b = 2 \sigma_{\hat{\theta}})$.

* If we want the error to be less than c, then 
$$ b  = 2 \sigma_{\hat{\theta}} < c$$

## Confidence Interval
Recall:
$$ (\hat{\theta} - z\_{\frac{\alpha}{2}} \sigma\_{\hat{\theta}},\hat{\theta} + z\_{\frac{\alpha}{2}} \sigma\_{\hat{\theta}} ) \quad \text{ where } \sigma\_{\hat{\theta}} = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$$

If we want an error less(bound) than $c$ then
$$ z\_{\frac{\alpha}{2}} \sigma\_{\hat{\theta}} < c$$

> If $\alpha$ is fixed then we are solving for $\sigma\_{\hat{\theta}}$

## Summary
* In general, to determine $n$ solve for
$$\sigma\_{\hat{\theta}}$$
* Note: since $n$ is on the denominator of $\sigma_{\hat{\theta}}$
    * $n$ is large $\rightarrow \sigma\_{\hat{\theta}}$ becomes small
