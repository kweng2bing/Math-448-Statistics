# Sufficiency

## Purpose
Suppose we observe a sample $x = (x\_{1},x\_{2},...,x\_{n})$ with density $p( x | \theta)$
* Sample contains information about $\theta$ which is unknown
* A summar statisitic for $x$ would give us the same information about $\theta$ if we have a **sufficient statistic**
    * If not, then we may lost some information


## Definition: Sufficiency
Let $Y\_{1}, Y\_{2}, Y\_{n}$ denote a random sample from a distribution with unknown parameter $\theta$. The statistic $T = T(Y_{1}, Y_{2},..., Y_{n})$ is said to be **sufficient** for $\theta$ if the conditional distribution of $( Y\_{1}, Y\_{2}, Y\_{n}) $, given $T=t$, does not depend on $\theta$
* Sufficiency can be thought of all the information with **regard to the parameter $\theta$** in the sample data given has been completely absorbed into the summary statistic, $T$, and hence there is nothing more to be found about $\theta$
### Example

Problem: Let $Y_{1}, ..., Y_{n} \sim B(p)$ that is $P(Y_{i}=1) = p \quad P(Y_{i}=0) = 1-p$ Show that $T = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}Y_{i}$ is a sufficient statistic for $p$.

We want to show that $p_{Y_{1},..., Y_{n}}(Y_{1} = y_{1}, ..., Y_{n} = y_{n} | T=t)$ does not depend on $\theta$

Recall that:

$B(p) \sim f(y) = p^{y} (1-p)^{1-y} \\
P \bigg( \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n} Y_{i} \sim B(p) \bigg) = \binom{n}{t} p^{t} (1-p)^{n-t}$
## Indicator function 

$$\mathbb{1}_{[\text{some events/inequality/ etc.}]}(x)$$
* If the described event occurs, the value is 1.
    * else value = 0

### Example

$$\mathbb{1}_{[x \geq 0]} \frac{1}{\beta}e^{\frac{-y}{\beta}} \Leftrightarrow 
\begin{cases}
\frac{1}{\beta}e^{\frac{-y}{\beta}} & \forall y \geq 0 \\
0 & \forall y < 0
\end{cases}
$$

## Sample Problems
### Example 1.
Let $Y_{1}, ..., Y_{n} \sim B(p)$ with $p$ being the unknown paramter

```math
\begin{align*}
L(p) &= \prod\limits_{i=1}^{n} p(y_{i}) \\
&= \prod\limits_{i=1}^{n} p^{y_{i}} (1-p)^{1- y_{i}} \\
&= p^{\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}y_{i}} (1-p)^{n - \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}y_{i}} \\
&= \bigg( \underbrace{\frac{p}{1-p}\bigg)^{\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n} y_{i}} (1-p)^{n}}_{g(t | p)} \times \underbrace{1}_{h(y)} \\
\end{align*}
```
