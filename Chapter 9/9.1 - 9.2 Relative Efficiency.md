# Relative Efficiency

## Definition of Efficiency
Given two unbiased estimators $\hat{\theta}\_{1}$ and $\hat{\theta}\_{2}$ of a parameter $\theta$ with variances $V(\hat{\theta}\_{1})$ and $V(\hat{\theta}\_{2})$, respectively, then the **efficiency of $\hat{\theta}\_{1}$ relative to $\hat{\theta}\_{2}$**, is defined to be the ratio

$$eff(\hat{\theta}\_{1},\hat{\theta}\_{2}) = \frac{V(\hat{\theta}\_{2})}{V(\hat{\theta}\_{1})}$$

* Relative efficiency allows us to compare unbiased estimators
* To compute efficiency, we need tto check $\hat{\theta}\_{1}$ and $\hat{\theta}\_{2}$ are both unbiased estimators
* $eff(\hat{\theta}\_{1},\hat{\theta}\_{2}) > 1$ says $\hat{\theta}\_{1}$ is a more accurate estimators

> Accuracy $\rightarrow$ Efficiency $\rightarrow$ Variance
