# Relative Efficiency


## Definition
Given two unbiased estimators $\hat{\theta}\_{1}$ and $\hat{\theta}\_{2}$ of a parameter $\theta$ with variances $V(\hat{\theta}_{1})$ and $V(\hat{\theta}_{2})$, respectively, then the **efficiency of $\hat{\theta}_{1}$ relative to $\hat{\theta}_{2}$**, is defined to be the ratio
$$eff(\hat{\theta}\_{1},\hat{\theta}\_{2}) = \frac{V(\hat{\theta}\_{2})}{V(\hat{\theta}\_{1})}$$
